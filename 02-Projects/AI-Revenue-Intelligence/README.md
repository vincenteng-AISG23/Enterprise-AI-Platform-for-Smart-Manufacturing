# 🎯 Business Problem

Most organizations face similar challenges:

* Revenue visibility is fragmented across systems
* Forecasting is reactive and inaccurate
* Customer management lacks prioritization
* Cross-sell opportunities are not systematically identified
* IT dashboards are descriptive but not actionable

---
